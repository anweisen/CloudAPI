# CloudAPI
Simplify development for multiple minecraft cloud systems

###### **Discontinued!**

This project is no longer in development as it isn't a project of use.
When I started this project, I thought it would be cool to be able to develop plugins & modules
for different cloud systems at once, but the implementation into these given systems is as in this state not appropriate.
